\title{warpPIE10P Face Image Dataset}
\format{
A data frame with 210 rows and 2,421 columns:
\describe{
\item{X1, X2, ..., X2420}{Grayscale pixel values (numeric).}
\item{class}{Factor indicating the subject label (1â€“10).}
}
}
\usage{
warpPIE10P
}
\description{
The warpPIE10P dataset consists of grayscale face images from 10 distinct individuals, sourced from the PIE face database. Each subject's face was captured under varying conditions, and all images were geometrically warped for alignment, resulting in high-dimensional feature data.
}
\details{
Each row represents an image sample, while each column (except the last) corresponds to a pixel value.
The final column \code{Person} indicates the subject's identity (from 1 to 10).
