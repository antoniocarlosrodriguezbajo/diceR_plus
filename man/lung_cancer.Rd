\title{Gene Expression Data for Lung Cancer}
\format{
A data frame with 203 rows and 3,313 columns:
\describe{
\item{X1, X2, ..., X3313}{Gene expression values (numeric).}
\item{class}{Factor indicating the tissue type (\code{AD}, \code{SQ}, \code{COID}, or \code{NL}).}

\description{
This dataset contains gene expression profiles from human lung tissue samples,
including both tumor and normal tissues. The data encompasses expression levels
for 3,313 genes across 203 samples. The samples represent four known classes:
Adenocarcinoma (AD), Squamous Cell Carcinoma (SQ), Carcinoid (COID), and
Normal Lung (NL). The AD class is known to be highly heterogeneous, and
substructure is believed to exist within this group.
}
\details{
Each row represents a patient sample, while each column (except the last) corresponds
to a gene. The final column \code{class} indicates the sample type.

The samples comprise 139 adenocarcinomas, 21 squamous cell carcinomas, 20 carcinoids,
and 17 normal lung tissues. Gene selection was performed to enrich for class-distinguishing
genes prior to analysis.
